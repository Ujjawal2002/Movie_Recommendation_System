# Movie_Recommendation_System
This project implements a Movie Recommendation System that suggests movies to users based on their ratings and preferences. The system helps users discover relevant movies by analyzing user behavior and movie characteristics using recommendation techniques.
To build a simple and effective recommendation system that provides personalized movie suggestions using:
Collaborative Filtering
Content-Based Filtering

# Recommendation Techniques Used
1.Content-Based Filtering
This method recommends movies based on movie features such as genre.
If a user likes a particular type of movie (for example, action or comedy), the system suggests similar movies with matching features.
2.Collaborative Filtering
This method recommends movies based on user similarity.
If two users have similar ratings for movies, the system recommends movies liked by one user to the other.
